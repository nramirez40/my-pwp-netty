<!-- Attitudes and behaviors -->
<h3>Attitudes and behaviors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
         <p>
            Karen is needing a system set up on her home computer to run numbers. Finding the
            vendors buying the same nest Wi-Fi system. Then the vendors buying google Wi-Fi.
            So she can better plan her inventory for each vendor. So she wants her home computer
            to be functional to get this data.

<!-- Frustrations and Behaviors -->
<h3>Frustrations and Behaviors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            She is still at home and isn't wanting to fall behind. Many of her co-workers have returned
            to the office. So she wants her home computer to be functional to get this
            data. Karen is not trusting her co-workers to set it up for her. She has a deadline to meet. The
            time it takes to get the systems ordered and sent off is critical. Since there is a shortage. So
            she needs the exact numbers to send to each vendor. So that the vendors are satisfied and will
            continue to order from Google.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- Goals -->
<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            So she would like to hire someone with the knowledge of functions and loops. Also,
            someone who is not connected to her company in any way. But has the knowledge and
            experience to get this problem fixed for her in a discreet but secure way.
        <p>
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- User Story -->
<h3>User Story</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Karen will have to be able to see examples of functions and loops done in other projects to
            make her decision. She will also need to see references and call to make sure that the person
            she hires is all about confidentiality. Also get feedback about the proficiency and time it took
            to get their projects completed for them. This is her bread and butter. So she needs to get it
            all set up in the next week.
