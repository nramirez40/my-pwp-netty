<!-- User Story -->

    <h4>
        Karen will have to be able to see examples of functions and loops done in other projects to
        make her decision. She will also need to see references and call to make sure that the person
        she hires is all about confidentiality. Also get feedback about the proficient and time it took
        to get their projects completed for them. This is her bread and butter. So she needs to get it
        all set up in the next week.
