<!-- Attitudes and Behaviors -->
    <h4>
        Karen is needing a system set up on her home computer to run numbers. Like her
        vendors buying the same nest Wi-Fi system. Then the vendors buying google Wi-Fi.
        So she can better plan her inventory for each vendor. She is new to the company and
        isn't wanting to fail. So she wants her home computer to be functional to get this
        data. Since she is working from home because of covid.
