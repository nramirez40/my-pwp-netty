    Netty Ramirez brings Front-End-Web-Development into a new visionary. This will be in bold colorful letters on my
    cover screen. The background will be a picture cover of one of myself or an art piece from my capstone.

<!-- About Me -->
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    This section will have a section showing my personality in the design of the sections. Also list a few things about
    myself on rows or columns. Another section having my skills listed. Also want to include referral quotes from
    teachers in a see through type background card. If that is allowed. Have an all simple flow that is functional and
    easy to use. My main goal is to have it functioning throughout and easy to scan. It will be a site that is more
    focused towards a more fun but professional companies. That the color on my site showcases my joy in doing this work
    but shows I am very experienced in what I can engineer.

    I want to showcase my projects on something like gallery pop-up or something similar. I want a link taking you to a
    synopsis of the project and what I contributed to the project. Also want to have a section to our group capstone site
    with a link taking you directly to the site. I also want some images on this section of my home office. If I have it
    set up in time.
