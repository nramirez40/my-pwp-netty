<!-- Welcome -->
<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>
    Netty Ramirez brings Front-End-Web-Development into a new visionary. This will be in bold colorful letters on my
    cover screen. The background will be a picture cover of one of myself or an art piece from my capstone.

<!-- About Me -->
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    This section will have a section showing my personality in the design of the sections. Also list a few things about
    myself on rows or columns. Another section having my skills listed. Also want to include referral quotes from
    teachers in a see through type background card. If that is allowed. Have an all simple flow that is functional and
    easy to use. My main goal is to have it functioning throughout and easy to scan.
